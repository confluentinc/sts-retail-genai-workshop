## <a name="step-1"></a>Log into Confluent Cloud

1. Log into [Confluent Cloud](https://confluent.cloud) and enter your email and password.

<div align="center" padding=25px>
    <img src="../common/images/login.png" width=50% height=50%>
</div>

2. If you are logging in for the first time, you will see a self-guided wizard that walks you through spinning up a cluster. Please minimize this as you will walk through those steps in this workshop. 

***

## <a name="step-2"></a>Create an Environment and Cluster

An environment contains clusters and its deployed components such as Apache Flink, Connectors, ksqlDB, and Schema Registry. You have the ability to create different environments based on your company's requirements. For example, you can use environments to separate Development/Testing, Pre-Production, and Production clusters. 

1. Click **+ Add Environment**. Specify an **Environment Name** and Click **Create**. 

>**Note:** There is a *default* environment ready in your account upon account creation. You can use this *default* environment for the purpose of this workshop if you do not wish to create an additional environment.

<div align="center" padding=25px>
    <img src="../common/images/environment.png" width=50% height=50%>
</div>

2. Now that you have an environment, click **Create Cluster**. 

> **Note:** Confluent Cloud clusters are available in 5 types: Basic, Standard, Enterprise , Dedicated and Freight. Basic is intended for development use cases so you will use that for the workshop. Basic clusters only support single zone availability. Standard , Enterprise, Dedicated and Freight clusters are intended for production use and support Multi-zone deployments. If you are interested in learning more about the different types of clusters and their associated features and limits, refer to this [documentation](https://docs.confluent.io/current/cloud/clusters/cluster-types.html).

3. Chose the **Basic** cluster type. 

<div align="center" padding=25px>
    <img src="../common/images/cluster-type.png" width=90% height=90%>
</div>

4. Click **Begin Configuration**. 
5. Choose GCP as preferred Cloud Provider, region (us-central1), and availability zone. 
6. Specify a **Cluster Name**. For the purpose of this lab, any name will work here. 

<div align="center" padding=25px>
    <img src="../common/images/create-cluster.png" width=70% height=70%>
</div>

7. View the associated *Configuration & Cost*, *Usage Limits*, and *Uptime SLA* information before launching. 
8. Click **Launch Cluster**.

## <a name="step-3"></a>Create a Flink Compute Pool

1. On the navigation menu, select **Flink** and click **Create Compute Pool**.

<div align="center" padding=25px>
    <img src="../common/images/create-flink-pool-1.png" width=60% height=60%>
</div>

2. Select **Region** and then **Continue**. (You have to use the region where the cluster was created in the previous step)
<div align="center" padding=25px>
    <img src="../common/images/create-flink-pool-2.png" width=60% height=60%>
</div>

3. Name you Pool Name and set the capacity units (CFUs) to **10**. Click **Finish**.

<div align="center" padding=25px>
    <img src="../common/images/create-flink-pool-3.png" width=60% height=60%>
</div>

> **Note:** The capacity of a compute pool is measured in CFUs. Compute pools expand and shrink automatically based on the resources required by the statements using them. A compute pool without any running statements scale down to zero. The maximum size of a compute pool is configured during creation. 

4. Flink Compute pools will be ready shortly. You can click **Open SQL workspace** when the pool is ready to use.

5. Change your workspace name by clicking **settings button**. Click **Save changes** after you update the workspace name.

***

## <a name="step-4"></a>Creates Topic and Walk Through Cloud Dashboard

1. On the navigation menu, you will see **Cluster Overview**. 

> **Note:** This section shows Cluster Metrics, such as Throughput and Storage. This page also shows the number of Topics, Partitions, Connectors, and ksqlDB Applications.

2. Click on **Cluster Settings**. This is where you can find your *Cluster ID, Bootstrap Server, Cloud Details, Cluster Type,* and *Capacity Limits*.
3. On the same navigation menu, select **Topics** and click **Create Topic**. 
4. Enter **shoes_orders** as the topic name, **3** as the number of partitions, skip the data contract and then click **Create with defaults**.'

<div align="center" padding=25px>
    <img src="../common/images/create-topic.png" width=50% height=50%>
</div>

5. Repeat the previous step and create a second topic name **shoes_clickstream** and **3** as the number of partitions and skip the data contract.

> **Note:** Topics have many configurable parameters. A complete list of those configurations for Confluent Cloud can be found [here](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/using/broker-config.html). If you are interested in viewing the default configurations, you can view them in the Topic Summary on the right side. 

7. After topic creation, the **Topics UI** allows you to monitor production and consumption throughput metrics and the configuration parameters for your topics. When you begin sending messages to Confluent Cloud, you will be able to view those messages and message schemas.

## <a name="step-7"></a>Create MongoDB Source Connector for shoes and customers details

The next step is to get initial shoes and customer data from MongoDB.

1. First, navigate to your workshop cluster.
2. Next, click on the **Connectors** link on the navigation menu.
3. Click on **Add Connector**
4. Now search for mongo

6. Review your selections and then click **Launch**.


> **Note:** It may take a few moments for the connectors to launch. Check the status and when both are ready, the status should show *running*. <br> <div align="center"><img src="../common/images/mongo-2.png" width=75% height=75%></div>

## <a name="step-8"></a>Stream Processing with Flink for getting trendy products, customer segements, and combine the records into one topic

Kafka topics and schemas are always in sync with our Flink cluster. Any topic created in Kafka is visible directly as a table in Flink, and any table created in Flink is visible as a topic in Kafka. Effectively, Flink provides a SQL interface on top of Confluent Cloud.

1. From the Confluent Cloud UI, click on the **Environments** tab on the navigation menu. Choose your environment.
2. Click on **Flink** from the menu pane
3. Choose the compute pool created in the previous steps.
4. Click on **Open SQL workspace** button on the top right.
5. Let's execute the following SQL queries to create the `latest_trends` table, which aggregates the top products and brands within a defined time period, updating every minute.

Let's begin by identifying the top products every minute.

```sql
CREATE TABLE top_products_every_minute ( 
    product_id STRING, 
    view_count BIGINT, 
    avg_view_time DOUBLE, 
    window_start TIMESTAMP_LTZ(3), 
    window_end TIMESTAMP_LTZ(3) 
    );
```

**How can we identify the most popular products over a defined time window?**

Before running below query, we should first explore the raw shoes_clickstream data to understand user interactions. This involves:

- Counting product views per minute to analyze engagement trends.

- Calculating the average time spent on each product to measure interest levels.

- Grouping and ranking them into 1-minute windows to track real-time trends.

Once we understand these metrics, we can proceed with ranking the top 5 products every minute. Let's try now running the below query.

6. Add a new query by clicking on + icon in the left of previous query to Insert records to the above table by running the following query.

```sql
INSERT  INTO top_products_every_minute 
    WITH ProductStats AS ( 
        SELECT product_id, 
        COUNT(*) AS view_count, 
        AVG(view_time) AS avg_view_time, 
        window_start, window_end FROM TABLE( 
        TUMBLE(TABLE shoes_clickstream, DESCRIPTOR(`$rowtime`), INTERVAL '1' MINUTE) 
        ) 
        GROUP BY product_id, window_start, window_end ), 

    RankedProducts AS ( 
        SELECT product_id, view_count, avg_view_time, 
        window_start, window_end, ROW_NUMBER() OVER ( 
        PARTITION BY window_start, window_end ORDER BY view_count DESC, avg_view_time DESC ) AS ranking 
        FROM ProductStats ) 

    SELECT product_id, view_count, avg_view_time, 
    window_start, window_end FROM RankedProducts 
    WHERE ranking <= 5;
```

Next, we will enhance `top_products_every_minute` by adding brand and shoe details. This involves joining with the `shoes` table to retrieve brand and shoe names for the top products. The resulting `top_shoes_with_details` table will offer a comprehensive view of trending products and brands every minute.  

Insert the correct column name for `<PRODUCT_ID_COLUMN>` from `top_products_every_minute`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE top_shoes_with_details (
    `timestamp` TIMESTAMP(3),
    WATERMARK FOR `timestamp` AS `timestamp` - INTERVAL '5' SECOND
) AS 
select *, now () as `timestamp` from top_products_every_minute as tp , 
`mongo.demo.shoes` as ms 
where ms.id=tp.<PRODUCT_ID_COLUMN>;
```

Let's aggregate all the trending brands and shoes over a time window. Insert the correct column name for `<BRAND_COLUMN>` from `top_shoes_with_details` and run the query. 

```sql
CREATE TABLE results_aggregated (
    `timestamp` TIMESTAMP(3),
    WATERMARK FOR `timestamp` AS `timestamp` - INTERVAL '5' SECOND
)  AS
SELECT LISTAGG(`<BRAND_COLUMN>`,'\n') OVER w AS `trending_brands`,
        LISTAGG(name,'\n') OVER w AS `trending_shoes`,
        SUM(view_count) OVER w AS `collective_view_count`,
        `timestamp`
    FROM top_shoes_with_details
  WINDOW w AS (
  PARTITION BY window_start,window_end
  ORDER BY `timestamp`
  RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '1' MINUTE PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW);
```

**Now, Let's Remove Duplicates**  

We'll create the `latest_trends` table by **deduplicating aggregated results**, ensuring only the most recent entry per time window is retained.  
This query assigns a **row number** to each record within the same `window_start` and `window_end`, ordered by `timestamp` (latest first), and keeps only the **latest record** per window. 

```sql
CREATE TABLE latest_trends AS 
    SELECT `trending_brands`,`trending_shoes`, 
    `collective_view_count`, `row_num`,
    window_start,window_end FROM ( 
        SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY window_start, window_end ORDER BY `timestamp` DESC) AS row_num 
        FROM TABLE(
        TUMBLE(TABLE `results_aggregated`, DESCRIPTOR(`timestamp`), INTERVAL '1' MINUTE)) ) 
    where row_num<=1;
```

Every customer is unique, and their shopping behavior varies. To provide personalized recommendations, we need to understand their purchasing patterns. So, let's segment our customers based on their recent purchase history, identifying frequent **shoppers**, **emerging buyers**, and **occasional customers**. 

7. Let's segment users based on their purchase frequency in `shoes_orders` to better understand their shopping behavior.Replace the correct table name for `<SHOE_ORDERS_TABLE_NAME>` and run the query. 

```sql
CREATE TABLE customer_segments_table AS 
    SELECT customer_id, `$rowtime` as event_rtime, COUNT(order_id) OVER ( 
    PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY `$rowtime` 
    RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '5' MINUTE PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW ) AS orders, 
    CASE 
        WHEN COUNT(order_id) OVER ( 
            PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY `$rowtime` 
            RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '5' MINUTE PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW ) > 3 
        THEN 'Frequent Shopper' 
        WHEN COUNT(order_id) OVER ( 
            PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY `$rowtime` 
            RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '5' MINUTE PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW ) BETWEEN 2 AND 3 
        THEN 'Emerging Shopper' 
        ELSE 'Occasional Buyer' END AS customer_segment 
    FROM <SHOE_ORDERS_TABLE_NAME>;
```

8. Create the final topic containing all the data needed for Gemini to generate product recommendations. Replace `<SEGMENTED_TABLE_NAME>` with the correct table name from the previous segmentation query and execute the query.

```sql
CREATE TABLE personalized_recommendation_input AS 
    select * from `<SEGMENTED_TABLE_NAME>` as s , 
    latest_trends as lt 
    where s.event_rtime BETWEEN lt.window_start AND lt.window_end;
```

## <a name="step-9"></a>Consume final topic and recommend shoes to customers with google gemini

1. Use confluent CLI to create connection with gemini

```sql
confluent login
confluent environment list
confluent env use <Environment ID>
confluent kafka cluster list
confluent kafka cluster use <Kafka Cluster ID>
confluent flink connection create googleai-ai-connection \
--cloud <Cloud Provider> \
--region <Region> \
--environment <Environment ID> \
--type googleai \
--endpoint https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest:generateContent \
--api-key <Gemini API Key>
```

2. Use the same connection to create a model in flink.

```sql
CREATE MODEL RECOMMEND
INPUT (`text` VARCHAR(2147483647)) 
OUTPUT (`output` VARCHAR(2147483647)) 
WITH ( 
    'googleai.connection' = 'googleai-ai-connection', 
    'googleai.system_prompt' = 'Generate a personalized product recommendation message', 
    'provider' = 'googleai', 
    'task' = 'text_generation' 
    );
```

3. Use the gemini model to get shoes/brands recommendation based upon the input gathered in the final topic.

```sql
SELECT * FROM personalized_recommendation_input, 
LATERAL TABLE( 
    ML_PREDICT('RECOMMEND' ,'Customer Segment:' || customer_segment || 
    ' , Trending Brands:' || trending_brands || 
    ' , Trending Products:' || trending_shoes || 
    ' , \n Craft a concise, engaging message recommending one or two relevant products or brands. Tailor the tone to match the customer’s segment and include a compelling call-to-action to drive engagement.')
    );
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE Recommendations AS SELECT customer_id , output FROM personalized_recommendation_input, 
LATERAL TABLE( 
    ML_PREDICT('RECOMMEND' ,'Customer Segment:' || customer_segment || 
    ' , Trending Brands:' || trending_brands || 
    ' , Trending Products:' || trending_shoes || 
    ' , \n Craft a concise, engaging message recommending one or two relevant products or brands. Tailor the tone to match the customer’s segment and include a compelling call-to-action to drive engagement.')
    );   
```

## <a name="step-10"></a>Elasticsearch Monitoring

The next step is to sink topics to elasticsearch for analytics and monitoring.

You can either use Elasticsearch Cloud services or self manage the elasticsearch with docker. Refer [`elk`](elk) for steps.

1. First, navigate to your workshop cluster.
2. Next, click on the **Connectors** link on the navigation menu.
3. Click on **Add Connector**
4. Now search for elastic

6. Review your selections and then click **Launch**.

7. Next step is to create Elasticsearch data-views and kibana-dashboard. You can use [`elasticsearch.ndjson`](elasticsearch.ndjson) to import the dashbaord.

8. Now Visit Elasticsearch UI and select Stack Management page under Management from the hamburger menu.
